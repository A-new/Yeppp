 * @mainpage Yeppp! library documentation for C# programmers
 *
 * @section Introduction	Introduction
 *
 * @Yeppp library is a collection of low-level functions optimized for modern CPU microarchitectures.
 * Each library function has several versions optimized for different processor microarchitectures.
 * During initialization @Yeppp library detects the processor it is running on, and chooses the optimal function implementations.
 *
 * Additionally, the library provides information about the CPU, such as processor vendor and microarchitecture,
 * and an OS- and hardware-independent interface to processor cycle counters, and high-resolution timers.
 *
 * @section Platforms	Supported Platforms
 *
 * In this release @Yeppp library supports the following hardware and software platforms:
 *  - x86 on Windows, Linux, and Android.
 *  - x86-64 on Windows and Linux.
 *  - ARM on Linux and Android.
 *  - MIPS on Android.
 *
 * @example CpuInfo.cs
 *
 * This example shows how to use @Yeppp library to get information about processor and supported instruction extensions:
 *
 * @example SystemTimer.cs
 *
 * This example shows how to use @Yeppp library to do cross-platform measurements of execution time using high-frequency system timer:
 *
 * @example CpuCycles.cs
 *
 * This example shows how to use @Yeppp library to measure the execution time in CPU cycles:
 *
 * @example Entropy.cs
 *
 * This example shows how to use @Yeppp library to compute the entropy of a distribution given by its probabilities:
